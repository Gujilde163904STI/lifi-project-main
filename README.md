# LIFI-PROJECT: AI-Augmented Modular Embedded Communication via Light Fidelity

## Overview

**LIFI-PROJECT** is an open, modular, AI-augmented embedded communication system that leverages Light Fidelity (LI-FI) as an alternative to traditional radio frequency (RF) for data transmission between Raspberry Pi and ESP8266-based IoT devices.

Our mission is to establish a robust, decentralized, and scalable framework for wireless device-to-device communication using photodiodes and light-based signaling. This approach is particularly advantageous in environments where RF is restricted, inefficient, or introduces security concerns—such as underground infrastructures, hospitals, aviation, and space-constrained industrial settings.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Each device (ESP8266, Raspberry Pi 3/4) operates with its own pre-flashed, independent firmware module. These modules are designed for:
  - Auto-configuration at first boot—no manual setup required.
  - Seamless, plug-and-play scalability for large IoT deployments.
  - Interoperability across device classes.

- **Light-Based Data Transmission (LI-FI)**  
  Utilizes photodiodes and custom hardware interfaces for reliable, low-latency, and interference-free optical communication—enabling deployment in sensitive or RF-hostile environments.

- **AI-Powered Build & Development Stack**  
  Integration of advanced development and automation tools:
  - **Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT**: Accelerate code generation, review, and documentation.
  - **Wokwi & Proteus 8**: Simulate and validate hardware designs and firmware logic before deployment.
  - **Dockerized CI Pipelines**: Streamline continuous integration, testing, and deployment across device targets.

- **Edge Computing Ready**  
  - Supports real-time processing and decision-making at the device level using ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi 3/4.
  - Designed for secure, energy-efficient operation in distributed IoT networks.

## Why LI-FI for IoT?

- **RF-Free Operation**: Critical for environments where radio interference is a risk or not permitted.
- **Enhanced Security**: Optical signals are highly localized and can be physically isolated.
- **Low Power & Scalable**: Ideal for dense sensor networks and battery-powered devices.

## Use Cases

- **Hospitals & Medical Facilities**: Maintain wireless connectivity without RF interference.
- **Underground & Industrial Sites**: Reliable signaling where conventional RF fails.
- **Aviation & Aerospace**: Secure, interference-free communication for onboard systems.
- **Smart Facilities**: Plug-and-play sensor/actuator networks for energy monitoring, automation, and safety.

## Architecture

- **Hardware**:  
  - **Transceivers**: Photodiodes, high-efficiency LEDs, and custom signal processing circuits.
  - **Edge Devices**: ESP8266 modules, Raspberry Pi 3/4 for local computation and control.

- **Firmware**:  
  - Modular, standalone firmware images for each device class.
  - Automatic network discovery and configuration at power-up.

- **Development Pipeline**:  
  - Hardware simulation (Wokwi/Proteus), code generation (AI tools), and automated testing (Docker CI).
